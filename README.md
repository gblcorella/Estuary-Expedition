## About 🐠
Estuary Expedition -- an educational game where players will help Eddie the Educator, Rachel the Researcher, and Stew the Steward at one of Delaware's estuaries.  Eddie introduces the player to the Blackbird Creek Reserve.  The player learns about species that are native to Delaware's estuaries and specific research tasks by helping Rachel catch and measure fish.  Then, the player assists Stew in creating a habitat map of the animals living in the estuary. Eddie provides fun facts about the animals througout the game and tests the players knowledge when mapping the animals.  Players can try to improve their score by catching and measuring more fish and developing a more extensive habitat map.
